# E-commerce Back End

## Description

I built the back end for an e-commerce site. I took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with my MySQL database.

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js.

## Installation

### Node installation on Windows

Please visit [Official Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

To install all node modules and dependencies, please run the command. `npm install`
